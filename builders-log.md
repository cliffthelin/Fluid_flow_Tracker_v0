| User Input | App Builder Output | AppBuilder Error Resolution | User Requested Refactor | Validation Test |

| The code returns the following error: ```The "/app/services/share" module does not provide an export named "isShareAvailable".``` Revise the code to address the error. | Added the missing `isShareAvailable` function to the share.ts file. The function checks if the Web Share API is available and likely to work by detecting if the app is running in an iframe, in a preview environment, or if the browser supports the Web Share API. | Fixed missing export in share.ts by implementing the `isShareAvailable` function that was being imported but wasn't defined in the file. | User requested a fix for the missing export error. | Share functionality test in DataManagement component that verifies if Web Share API is available on the current platform. |
